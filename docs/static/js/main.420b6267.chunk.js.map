in digitizing maps and constructing multi-story monolithic buildings, \n                    working on site as a geodesist. I enjoyed the work and how useful it felt to society and hoped to \n                    make a great career there. But unfortunately, the construction industry in Russia turned out to be \n                    heavy with corruption and sexism, so I decided to change my profession. I always enjoyed physics \n                    and applying it to the world, so I decided to put my knowledge of optics and natural phenomena to \n                    become a photographer.\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"description\">I taught myself all main photography principles such as color, light, \n                    and composition, and worked as a fashion photographer for five years until December 2019. \n                    My works were featured in magazines, and photography exhibitions in Europe. \n                    Despite that, further growth in photography depended too much on the subjective tastes of people \n                    and connections, and too little on applying knowledge to produce a great picture. \n                    So decided to apply my knowledge of science and visual arts to a perfect fit: frontend development.\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"description\">Starting from January 2020, I have been studying a growing stack of \n                    frontend technologies every day.
